## Description
This repostory represents the first homework of the laboratory component of the subject known as "Application Development Tendencies" (INS364L), where the application consists on validating the sequence of numbers known as the social security number. 

A social security number (SSN) refers to a numerical identifier assigned to U.S. citizens and other residents to track income and determine benefits (Kagan, J., 2021, [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp)).

A valid SSN (Social Security Number) must satisfy the following conditions:

    * The second part should have 2 digits and it should be from 01 to 99.
    * The third part should have 4 digits and it should be from 0001 to 9999.
